# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Booking Application (Full Stack) ‚Äì Work in Progress

A full-stack restaurant reservation platform where customers can sign up, log in, browse restaurants, and (eventually) make reservations online. Restaurants will also have their own dashboard to manage bookings and capacity.

> This project is currently under development. Core frontend and backend functionality is implemented, with more features planned.

---

## ‚úÖ Features (Implemented So Far)

- Customer sign-up and login (React + Next.js + REST API)
- Backend API endpoints for user registration and login
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT authentication with protected routes
- Customers can view a list of restaurants (dummy data from backend)
- Responsive frontend layout using Tailwind CSS
- Reusable UI components (e.g., `RestaurantCard`, form components)
- PostgreSQL database with `Users` and `Restaurants` tables
- Express + TypeScript backend with reusable middleware and database connection pool

## Motivation
This project was built as a full-stack capstone-style personal project to showcase:
- REST API design
- TypeScript full-stack development
- JWT authentication and protected routes
- Database design and relational constraints
- Scalable folder architecture (services, models, controllers, components)
